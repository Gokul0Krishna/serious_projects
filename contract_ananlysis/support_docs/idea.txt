   - Generate compliance reports
   - Track regulatory changes

3. Contract Comparison
   - Compare multiple versions of contracts
   - Highlight changes and implications
   - Suggest negotiation points

4. Risk Scoring
   - Overall contract risk score
   - Clause-level risk assessment
   - Historical risk patterns

5. Auto-summarization
   - Executive summaries of contracts
   - Key obligations timeline
   - Financial terms extraction

Tech Stack:
- LLM: GPT-4 or Claude-3 Opus (long context for full contracts)
- Legal NER: Fine-tuned BERT on legal entities
- Clause Classification: SetFit on contract clauses
- RAG: LlamaIndex with legal knowledge base
- Document Processing: PyMuPDF, Docling
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: React with PDF annotation
- Storage: PostgreSQL + S3

Legal Knowledge Base:
- Regulatory databases (SEC, EU regulations)
- Case law (publicly available)

- Audit trail of all reviews
- Bulk contract processing
- Multi-jurisdiction support

Analysis Types:
1. Pre-signature review (before signing)
2. Post-signature compliance monitoring
3. Renewal analysis (should we renew?)
4. Obligation tracking (what must we do?)
5. Vendor risk assessment

DEPLOYMENT:
- On-premises option for sensitive data
- Cloud deployment with encryption
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- Role-based access control

WHY THIS MATTERS:
